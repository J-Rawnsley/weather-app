# Weather App

## Description

This app gets real-time weather for selected locations in the UK. It fetches data from OpenWeatherMap.org and creates a visualisation to give the user an instant over view of the weather forecast for the next 6 days. By building this prject, I learnt a lot about asyncronous functions and fetching data, creating modular and scalable layout patterns with React, using both state and effect hooks to dynamically update the user interface. I also learned how to use a serverless backend function to hide secrets such as, in this case, an API key. I used Netlify development mode to build and test the serverless function and linked to GitHub for continuous auto-deployment.

Of course, the main limitation of this weather app is that it will only work for pre-selected locations in the UK. I decided that integrating a location search and factoring in different time zones were beyond the scope of this project, but may be something that I will learn about in a future project.
